# JavaSudoku
Takes an existing sudoku and automatically imports it into
[Sudokupad](https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/).
Uses [Penpa+](https://swaroopg92.github.io/penpa-edit/) to set
the sudoku and then uses this [conversion site](https://marktekfan.github.io/sudokupad-penpa-import/)
to import the sudoku into Sudokupad. 

Available choices are 
- [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku)
- [Websudoku](https://www.websudoku.com/)

All difficulties of all the websites can be chosen

# Future Improvements

- Add a log file for converted Websudoku sudoku
- Improve the UI of the program
- Figure out how Penpa / [f-puzzles](https://www.f-puzzles.com/)
does puzzle creation and compression
